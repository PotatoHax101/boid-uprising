# boid-uprising
We should have listened to the warning signs, but it's too late now, for the evil boid uprising is upon us!

This experimental project is based on Craig Reynolds' [paper](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/papers/1987/boids.html) about his distributed behavioral model of creating flocks, herds, and schools of animal life, called '[Boids](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/)'.
